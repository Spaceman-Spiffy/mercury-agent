"""1403-chain glyph flags — period-grounded replacement of stock emoji.

Fork-only cosmetic layer (Mercury install, Peter 2026-08-19). Rewrites the
gateway's LINE-LEADING event/tool emoji to IBM 1403 print-chain flag tokens
before any text leaves for Matrix. Applied in MatrixAdapter.format_message —
the single outbound chokepoint (both send() and edit_message() route through
it), so tool-activity bubbles, lifecycle notices, slash-command reports
(/status, /usage), and streamed edits are all converted in one place.

Doctrine (grounded 2026-08-18): the RTCC's IBM 1403 line printers carried a
48-character chain — A-Z, 0-9, and twelve specials (& , . - $ * / % # @ and
the not-equal/lozenge). That set is the whole glyph vocabulary of a period
NASA printout. Attested flagging idioms: the margin asterisk (* out-of-limits,
** urgent), words-as-flags (GO / NOGO / HOLD — the loop's own vocabulary),
and VOX for voice. Chosen set: "A with VOX".

Rules:
  * LINE-LEADING ONLY. An emoji mid-sentence in agent prose is left alone;
    every gateway-emitted marker leads its line.
  * Unknown emoji pass through untouched — this is a flag map, not a
    scrubber.
  * Variation selectors (U+FE0F) on the marker are consumed with it.
  * Pure text-to-text; no markdown or color concerns (the phone styles
    tokens if it chooses; the wire stays plain).
