click() sequence: clamp -> open device -> settle -> move -> ASSERT the

It refuses to click when the pointer is off target.

Failures #2/#4 (MEASURED 2026-08-21): a uinput ABS range declared over the
PHYSICAL panel put every click at 0.8x, and with no cursor readback the miss
was invisible — which invited a fabricated explanation. The assert here makes
that class of failure structurally impossible: a mis-mapped move is caught
BEFORE the button fires, and reported as a refusal with the measured delta.

Device notes, all measured (spike 004 corroborates both):
  * settle after device creation — kwin/libinput must enumerate the new
    device or events silently vanish. Our measurement: ~2.0 s required
    (spike 004 uses 500 ms; keep ours).
  * INPUT_PROP_DIRECT so libinput maps the axes to screen coordinates.
  * ABS range declared over the DERIVED logical desktop; targets pass
    through unscaled. Never the physical panel.
